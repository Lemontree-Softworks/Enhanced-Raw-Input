## About
"Enhanced Raw Input" is ideal for supporting all gaming input devices on Windows. All devices recognized by Windows as HID game controllers are supported. It is a direct replacement for the included “Raw Input” plugin with extended capabilities and does not have the limitations of it, such as: no hotplug support, no multiplayer support, or simple use of the D-pad.
